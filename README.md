# Playing with MySymptoms data

This is documentation of my rambling exploration of data I've been collecting within the MySymptoms Android app. It's part diary of the process, part (soon) code for extracting useful properties from the data and playing with it.

## Requirements

- make
- python 2.7
- your MySymptoms database placed into the root directory and named `mySymptoms.sqlite` (see bottom of `01_getting_some_data.md`)

## Running it

So far it doesn't do much but you can run it with:
```console
$ make
```
